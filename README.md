# My Omarchy Tweaks

This repository contains a suite of automated, TUI-driven (Text-based User Interface) scripts to customize a fresh Arch Linux + Omarchy installation to my personal preferences.

The primary goal of this project is to create a **safe, repeatable, and non-destructive** way to apply customizations. It is designed to be resilient to Omarchy updates by avoiding direct modification of core configuration files wherever possible, favoring overrides instead.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **TUI-Driven Interface**: A clean, dialog-based menu for applying all tweaks.
- **Selective Application**: Choose to apply all tweaks at once (`--all` flag) or select them individually from a menu.
- **Package Management**: Install a curated list of applications from official repositories and the AUR.
- **Hyprland Customization**:
  - Sets up a 3-monitor layout with correct scaling.
  - Configures a Spanish keyboard layout.
  - Removes all window gaps and transparency for a clean, flat look.
- **Theme & Icon Customization**:
  - Modifies Waybar to display application icons next to the workspace number.
  - Applies a custom "underline" highlight to the active workspace.
- **System Tweaks**:
  - Changes the default user shell to **Fish**.
  - Provides a toggle script for the `hypridle` screen locking service.
- **Safety First**: Automatically creates backups of any modified configuration files.
